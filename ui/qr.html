          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Among all the modern trends in restaurant marketing, the one which is gaining grounds in popularity is the use of QR code in placing orders. By scanning a restaurant's QR code, images and details of available meals pop up on the customer's mobile device. With this technology, customers can swipe through different meals, their ratings, other customer's reviews and can also share their experiences of not just the meal they had but also the restaurant in general. This technology allows overlaying digital content in real time on a customer's phone, engaging customers in exciting ways not experienced in the before.

          <h2>Methodology</h2>
          <p>A survey method was adopted in this study to get data on public opinion and attitude towards the use QR code and mobile application  in placing orders in restaurants. A total of five restaurants (all located in Lagos, Nigeria) were invlolved in this process. While the intended number was ten, government restrictions on public gathering due to COVID-19 was a challenge to meet the target. Also, the responses from customers in the five restaurants seemed to be repeatative or similar.

            While the main objective of this research was to understand and design new ways of ordering food in restaurants using Quick Response, interactions with prospective users revealed a handful of users were open to using the new technology on one hand and just a few were reluctant to make changes from their traditional ways of food ordering.
          </p>
          <h2>Proposed functionalities</h2>
          <p>
            What was fascinating the most about this study was the proposed functionalities which revealed how users are open to embracing new ideas in smart food ordering. Some of the suggestions include
          </p><br>
          <ul>
            <li><span>3D Models : </span>  The use of augmented reality and 3D models for better rotational and swiping experiences</li>
            <li><span>Tags : </span>  Use of tags to get info such as ingredients and preparation procedures of meals users are unaware of. </li>
            <li> <span>Time display : </span> In this feature, users can view their approximate order time. This is dependent on other factors such as chosen meal and number of orders made on the same meal</li>
            <li><span>I am feeling lucky : </span>  "I am feeling lucky" was a metaphoric statement which signifies choosing meals based on the application's recommendation and it turns out to be just what you needed. Such recommendations could be made based on weather, temperature and season parameters </li>     
          </ul>
