          <p>
            Designed to bridge the gap between handymen and clients,
            Handy-services provides a platform where home and office owners can
            find top rated handymen in their cities. After understanding the
            “one-time-service” nature of handy jobs, I was motivated to design
            an app where handy experts could easily be contacted for a quick
            service. By registering an account, users have access to five main
            handy categories namely; Carpenter, Plumber, Electrician, Painter
            and Tile setter.

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          With demands for Handy services steadily increasing, the need to
          create an online presence has become unavoidable
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="concept">
        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>
          Building a solid online presence will increase a handyman’s client
          base, market security and control over his business.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="concept">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          Handy Service (the app) is designed to bridge the gap between Handymen
          and clients by giving the former better online presence

          <h2>Usability test</h2>
          <p>
            With the need to create a user-centered design, I commenced my
            usability test by getting user stories after providing them with a
            synopsis of what Handy Service is all about. Using the prototype I
            made with Figma, the next step was querilla testing intended to
            further reveal the users emotions and impressions about the app.

          <h2>Feedback</h2>
          <p>
            Out of five participants of the querilla test, three strongly agreed
            that the app was very easy to use while the other two had a neutral
            opinion. Nevertheless, users feedback promted the following updates
            in the final design
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>Add job option : </span> While testing did not involve going
              through uploading a job on the app, options of users being able to
              add jobs was expected by a couple of users. This was not present
              in the initial designs
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Hourly rates : </span> One user expected hourly rates to be
              on expert's profile, an option worth considering but was left for
              negotiation between client and handyman
            </li>

            <li>
              <span>White spacing: </span> Some initial designs were apparently
              sophisticated with unnecessary icons and animations
            </li>
